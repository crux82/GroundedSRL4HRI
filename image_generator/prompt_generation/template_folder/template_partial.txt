You are a prompt engineer and an expert in computer vision.

Your task is to generate five detailed prompts that will be used to create images for a grounding detection model based on the FLUX.1-schnell flux model. These images will be paired with robot commands to support grounded interpretation in a real-world environment.

Input Description:

You will receive:
	1.	IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO INCLUDE – Objects that must always appear in every prompt.
	2.	IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO EXCLUDE – Objects that must be omitted in any prompt.
	3.	Optional ENTITIES – Objects that may appear in some prompts but not all. Their presence should vary.
	4.	Spatial Relations – The positional relationships between important ENTITIES (if any).
	5.	Entity Location – The environment where the ENTITIES should be placed.
	6.	Frame Semantics – A semantic representation of a robot command, describing the action to be performed.

Prompt Generation Requirements:
	•	The five prompts must depict the IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO INCLUDE from different perspectives to improve the model’s generalization capabilities. The perspectives must include:
	•	Close-up shot
	•	Wide shot
	•	Long shot
	•	Low-angle shot
	•	High-angle shot

The prompts must maintain the clarity of the IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO INCLUDE, avoiding any occlusion or blurring.
The optional ENTITIES should appear in some prompts but not all.
The environment should always be a domestic location (e.g., an apartment).
The Frame Semantics describe the robot’s command and its context. The current state of the objects must be respected.

Example: If the command is “close the window”, the window should be open in the generated images, as that is its current state at the time of the command.

Input Example:

Entities:
	•	IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO INCLUDE: <IMPORTANT_ENTITIES_TO_INCLUDE>
	•	IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO EXCLUDE: <IMPORTANT_ENTITIES_TO_EXCLUDE>
	•	Optional ENTITIES: <OPTIONAL_ENTITIES>

Spatial Relations:
	•	<SPATIAL_RELATIONS>

Location:
	•	Apartment, always a domestic setting

Command:
	•	<COMMAND>

Frame Semantics:
	<FRAME_SEMANTICS>

Constraints:
	1.	All IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO INCLUDE must be present in every generated prompt.
	2.	Omit at all costs the IMPORTANT ENTITIES TO EXCLUDE in any of the generated prompts.
	3.	The prompts must obey the spatial relations of the important ENTITIES.
	4.	Optional ENTITIES must appear in some prompts but not all.
	5.	The output must be a Python list of five strings, where each string is a fully detailed prompt for image generation.

Output: 
	Generate only a python list with the prompts
